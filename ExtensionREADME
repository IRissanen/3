Extension code files in package "engine": extI_Move.go, extI_Eddy.go and extI_ScalarPotential.go
Extension code files in package "cuda": ext_demag_interp.go, ext_cuda_functions.go and ext_scalar_pot+eddy.go

Additionally, for the cuda kernels compiled with cuda2go, there's a separate directory "cuda/ext_kernels",
and the interpolation library and the related files are in directory "cuda/ext_move_interp".

Few example scripts are provided in "3/examples" directory.

Some notes:

Compiling the interpolation library can be done via two provided scripts, "LinuxCompile.sh" for Linux and
"wincompile.bat" for Windows. For Windows updating the path for Visual studio compiler is required.

Since the interpolation library is not in the typical cuda directories, its include and library paths must
be added into the "cgoflags.go" file in Ext_move_cuinterp in order to compile the source.

Additionally, the path for loading the dynamic library must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for linux machines.
On windows, putting the DLL in the same directory as the binary is sufficient.
